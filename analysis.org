* Section 1
Vandalism edits happen when a user or a bot replaces the whole content
of an article with rubbish or offensive language. Below in Figure
ref:NumOfVandalismEdits the number of vandalism edits per gender are plotted.

We have to compare the portions of these vandalism edits. The Figure
ref:percentagesOfVandalEdits shows the percentages of vandalism edits
in our dataset. One can observe that the percentage for females is one
and a half times the percentage for males. We should note here that
our dataset is imbalanced and revisions for males counts over 40000
revisions compared to almost 20000 for females.

Figure ref:varianceOfSubjectivity shows the change of subjectivity for
each person. We have compared the subjectivity at the beginning of
each biography to the subjectivity of the last snapshot we
got. Subjectivity for males has been reduced to 80% of them compared
to 58% for females. *To be discussed* 
#+CAPTION: This plot shows how much the subjectivity for each biography has changed from its birth to the last snapshot we got.
